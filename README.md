This is my TO_DO_LIST Assignment with JAVASCRIPT, HTML AND CSS
TO DO LIST CODE DESCRIPTION
This code contains a basic to-do list application written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 It has got the ability to add items, mark items as completed, and remove items as described below.

1.	Close Buttons: The close button event is inside the newElement function.
2.	List Update: When new elements are added, the close variable (a list of close buttons) should be updated, so the newly added elements can have the same event handler.
3.	The newElement function includes input validation to avoid empty list items/ Input Validation: Validating the user input ensures it is not empty and provide feedback that you need to write something to be added on the list item. 
4.	Checked items are by clicking that particular item/items and it strike through.
5.	Clicking the close button will hide the item/ the removeItem function is updated to remove a list item when the close button is clicked.
6.	You click add button if you want to create a new list item
ALL THE ABOVE IS SEEN IN THE CODE
